# DCF Valuation Toolkit

## Purpose
This project is the first project for my first semester of a 5-year personal development plan. The goal is to build a simple DCF Valuation Toolkit to learn the basics of Python, Git Bash, and SQL. This project is also directly related to my Economics minor and personal interest in investing.

## MVP Goals
The "Minimum Viable Product" for this script will:
- Ask the user for inputs (like FCF growth and discount rate).
- Calculate a final intrinsic value per share.
- Print the result to the console.
