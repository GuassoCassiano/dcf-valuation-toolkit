# DCF Valuation Toolkit

## Purpose
This project is the first project for my first semester of a 4-year personal development plan. The goal is to build a simple DCF Valuation Toolkit to learn the basics of Python, Git Bash, and SQL. This project is also directly related to my math minor and personal interest in investing.

## MVP Goals
The "Minimum Viable Product" for this script will:
- Ask the user for inputs (like FCF growth and discount rate).
- Calculate a final intrinsic value per share.
- Print the result to the console.

## Status 
**V1.0 (MVP) - Completed on 10/23/2025**
- All the core function for the DCF Calculations are built and working
- The script takes user inputs and and prints the final results

## Lessons Learned
* This was my first project moving from MATLAB to Python
* The main challenge was the differences in syntax 
* I learned to seperate logic from execution
* I practiced using standard python formatting (PEP 8 snake_case)
* I learned how to use git and version control
* This was my first time using SQL so I learned the basics of databases/tables
* Lastly I learned some of the safety protocols associated with SQL (SQL injections) and git (.gitignore)

## Reflections & Lessons
* This was a great first project to transition from MATLAB to Python. The core logic was straightforward, allowing me to focus on learning the new syntax for functions, f-strings, and lists.
* This project marked the start of me learning proper version control. I practiced the full `git add` and `git commit` workflow to build a clean project history.
* I learned the importance of separating "tool" functions (like `calculate_present_value`) from the "execution" logic (the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block).
